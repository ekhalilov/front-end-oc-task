# Take home assignment - Calendar App
  Hello! ðŸ‘‹

  Congratulations on making it to the second round! 
  
  
  TEST

## Goal of the task
  Your goal here is to build a simple calendar app in React. The app allows users to create appointments for any date and see already created events for the currently active month.
## Todo list
  - [ ] Create a calendar grid for the given month and year. Make sure that every month starts from the appropriate day of the week.
  - [ ] Add a feature that allows users to switch month and year
  - [ ] Add highlighting for today's date
  - [ ] Add a feature that allows users to create an event.
      - When users click on the day, they should see a "create event" form (e.g. popup) that includes Hour, Minutes, and Event Name fields
      - After users fill in the form, the event data should be saved somewhere on the client side.
  - [ ] In the bottom of the calendar, show a list of events for the currently active month only.
      - Events should be sorted by date/time
      - Events should have the following format: "{Day} {Month} {Year} {HH}:{MM} - {EventName}"
  - [ ] Make it look right on mobile devices
  - [ ] Make a design change to improve the user experience and/or style it according to OneClass design     

## Set up
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the app.

## Additional Notes
  - Using React.js is required
  - You can't use JS calendar libs
  - If you want to use SCSS, just add a `src/**/*.scss` file. The watcher will find every Sass file in `src` subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it. You can also use any other preprocessor if you want. See [Adding a CSS Preprocessor (Sass, Less etc.)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc)

Good Luck! ðŸš€
